Do NOT create php projects with a space in the name (spaces in URLs are ugly
in the browser's address and can cause problems).

Create the database using the DDL provided via the SQL tab in phpMyAdmin.

This database uses the results of the games when the UNA Softball team won 
the national title!

Read and understand ALL of the code first!  This will really help you with 
Exam II.

Look for the TODO tags.  Search (with control-f) in Netbeans and it will 
highlight them.

Fix all of the TODO items and make sure that everything works smoothly 
(there may be other bugs lurking here and there -- there usually are...).
